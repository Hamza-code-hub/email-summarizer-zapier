# ðŸ“§ Email Summarizer Zap (Zapier Automation)

This project demonstrates a **Zapier automation** that:
1. Detects new emails in Gmail
2. Uses **AI to summarize** the email content
3. Sends the summary to **Google Sheets, Slack, or WhatsApp**

It is useful for automatically **summarizing long emails** and sending quick summaries to your team or saving them for future reference.
